"Oh"
The gentleman seemed lost for words for a moment as he stared at the words Coy had written, still casually tossing breadcrumbs towards the mob of pigeons at his feet.
"Was you crash recent?"
Coy nods their head
"There was an accident that occured not too far away from here. Somewhere down the intersecton."
Coy eyes go wide, they had been looking for information regarding it. But no one was willing to give them any clues.
(Where?) 
Coy writes on the notebook, wanting answers.
"Hmm.... I think it was... the intersection at Proccidanenet St"
Coy had an idea of where that might be 
(Thanks)
Coy quickly jumps up, packing their bag before running off in the direction of Proccidanenet St. Quickly leaving the park's area
The pigeon man yells something of warning at Coy's quickly retreating back.
But Coy doesn't hear the words, too busy racing towards the answers they wanted.
