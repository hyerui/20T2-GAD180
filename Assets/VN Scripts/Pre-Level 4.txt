Their parents had decided to take them to therapy.
Coy reluctantly went along with their plan.
Arriving at the therapy center, they waited around until they were called into the office.
"Coy?"
Coy raised their hand, signalling where they were. 
The doctor, in turn, signals them towards their office. 
Coy and their family make their way into the office, sitting themselves down on one side of the table, oppsite to the therapist
"Hello, Coy. I'm Sarah Mist. Can you tell me why you came to see me?"
Coy pulls out their notebook, not trusting their voice. Beginning to write.
