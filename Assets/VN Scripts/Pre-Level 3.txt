The car crash was a mistake. 
Coy's breathing shallow as their legs burned from the strain. 
Their footsteps beating against the pavement as the monster unleashed by them gained on them.
"There's no running from me Coy"
It's voice sent shivers running down Coy's back, cold sweat dripping down their face as they rushed back home.
Pupple ran close behind them, somehow putting up a fight against a shadowy creature 10x it's size
They remembered everything.
From the morning.
With Max.
To the crash.
With the darkness threatening to swallow them.
It was...
Too much, they couldn't. 
Home.
Keep Running home, it'd be safe. 
Right?
A voice continually scream 'RUN', pushing Coy forward. The house gradually coming home. 
Coming up in front of the door, they bang on it. 
Let them in.
Let them in.
They were gonna die!
If the monster could steal their voice.
It could probably steal their life too.
They needed to get in.
Coy's dad opens the door, a bit shocked from Coy's appearance 
"What's wrong? Coy?"
"I-I-I"
They couldn't get anything out, looking towards the monster, hoping against hope it wasn't getting closer.
It was.
Coy tries to rush past their dad, but is stopped
"hey, hey. You don't look good at all, what happened?"
Coy's voice wasn't working, they couldn't get the words out. 
But they had to get in, pushing past their dad, they get into the house. 
Pointing to the door as they scramble inside, motioning for their dad to clsoe it. 
But it was too late, the monster rushed in. 
"Your voice is mine!"
IT cackles as it draws closer to Coy.
"Coy, book!"
Coy turns in the direction of the voice, noticing Pupple pushing the notebook towards them.
Rushed, their heart beating rapidly, they open the book and begin to write.
