The vague mumbling of voices. Some loud. Some soft. Yet utterly indescernible
Creaks of red break through the dark fog of unconsciousness as dull thuds rock their body about.
Time flowed like mud. The sounds, sights and feeling melding into a mindless swirl. Unidentifiable among the mist of sense
...
*Beep*
*Beep*
*Beep*
A repetitive beep roused Coy to consciousness. A groan escaping them as their eyes creaked open, their blurry vision discerning the soft light filtering into the room.
Blinking their eyes, their vision gradually clears. Their limbs heavy as they stared up at the ceiling.
It was.... quiet
Where were they?
"Coy? You awake?"
Startled by the question, Coy freezes up. Wincing as tingles of pains spark about their body. Taking a moment before turning their head to the side. 
Greeted by the sight of their friend, Max, sitting on a seat beside them.
"Yea-"
Their voice comes out a croak, the words catching in their throat as it began to burn. Tears beginning to form at the brim of their eyes, as the pain forces the drowsiness out of their system.
"Hey, uuh bro, you ok there?"
Coy shakes their head in response, wiping the teardrops away as they point to their throat. 
"H... urts"
"Hurts?"
Coy wraps their hands around their throat, trying in vain to soothe the pain, even a little. The fire in their throat growing worse as their fingers make contact.
Tears beginning to flow dwon their face as sobs rock their body, gasping for air through the pain.
"Um, uuh..."
Lost, Max look around the room frantically. Something to help their friend. 
Scanning the tabletop, they find something. 
"Here Coy!"
They slide an open notebook into Coys lap, putting a pen in their hand
"Write and uuh, tell me what you need."
His words take a moment to register within Coy's pain addled mind. 
Before they open the notebook and begin to messily scribble. A strange blob of purple following their pen as it moved across the page.
