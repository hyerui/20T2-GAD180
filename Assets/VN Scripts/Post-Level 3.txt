Their dad quickly rushes forward, seeing Coy's scribbled scream of help, quickly pulling them into a hug
"It's ok now, I'm here. Nothing will hurt you"
Coy's shaking continues as they stare at the monster over their dad's shoulder.
It's form beginning to flicker.
"Consider yourself safe this time"
Flicking further, it began to fade
"You won't be so lucky next time"
It dissipitates into nothing.
Watching for a bit longer, it seemed the creature was gone.
Even if it was just for now.
Coy let out a breath they didn't know they were holding. Their heartrate returning to normal.
They were so tired....
A darkness began to close in, enveloping them.
But this time, a comforting and familiar darkness.
